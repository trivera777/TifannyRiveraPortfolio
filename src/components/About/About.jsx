            Hi my name is Tifanny! I come from a small town in Colorado called Greeley.
            I was born in Mexico but raised in Colorado the majority of my life.
            <br />
            For the past five years I have been working in the banking industry. 
            Five years is a long time. For me anyway, and for the goals that I have 
            for my life. 
            <br />
            By some miracle, as I was hunting for jobs, I came across
            a jo that required coding experience. I wasn't really sure what that was,
            and that's what started it all.
